## Project Objective
This project will simulate the autonomous operation  in a warehouse in Gazebo of a robotic arm to sort inventory incoming on a conveyor belt. 

## Contributions
The Fetch robot will be used to simulate operations in an industrial environment. This can help increase efficiency.

## Project Plan
The redball code from Fall 2018 will be adjusted to create an object moving as if on a conveyor belt. 
The Fetch Robot manual, Moveit tutorial and code from other projects done with Fetch will be used as guidance when instructing the robot.
Chapter 12 and 14 of textbook will us create and use distinguishing features on the models so that the robot can sort objects according to their features.   

## Milestones/Schedule Checklist

## Measures of Success
- [ ] Robotic arm can lift stationary object
- [ ] Robotic arm can move to specific location and release object
- [ ] Creation of conveyor belt in Gazebo
- [ ] Robotic arm can pick and place objects that were initially moving
- [ ] Robot can differentiate between items of different colors
